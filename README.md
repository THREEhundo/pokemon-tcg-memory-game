# Pokemon Trading Card Memory Game

![App Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/T4a6kOI.png)

## Description

This is a memory game. It's a fun app if you were into the Pokemon Trading Card Game when you were a kid, or if you are into them now. 10 Cards per round are shown. The cards are reshuffled after every click. Once all 10 are clicked a new deck is shown. If the same card is clicked twice the game resets. There are 10 decks to get through to win.

## Technology Used

HTML5
CSS
JavaScript
ReactJS

## Pain Spots

- Switching from using thenables to try catch.

- Ordering the implementation of states.

- Understanding that useEffects ran from top to bottom.

- Used multiple useEffects for connected states which created an endless loop. Combined into the useEffect that had the data fetched.

- Changed currentScore and highScore from useStates to useRefs.


## Optimizations

- Make app responsive.

- Add animation to clicking wrong card.

## Examples:
